## Concepts covered

1. Types of tests

   - unit tests
   - integration tests
   - end-to-end tests
   - visual tests

2. Testing libraries and tools
3. Integrating tests into CI
4. Pros and cons of testing
5. Hints on writing testable code

## A story of developing a feature

[Global average temperature visualization](https://gelio.github.io/temperature-heat-map/public/)

---

1. API returns an array of the following objects:

   ```js
   {
     "year": 1753,
     "month": 1,
     "temperature": 7.29
   }
   ```

2. Map each temperature to a specific color
3. Display the chart (e.g. using `recharts`)

## Renders fine, but what are the downsides?

---

## Downsides

1. Multiple concerns in one file/function (data fetching, data processing, handling errors,
   rendering results)
2. Mixed concerns could be harder to read and comprehend
3. Difficulty in automated testing

---

## What is _automated testing_?

<Components.ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>execution of a software component to evaluate its properties</li>
    <li>verifying that the code is correct</li>
    <li>
      verifying that components work well with each other (
      <em>integrate well</em>)
    </li>
    <li>verifying that the system works as designed</li>
    <li>using software to imitate user's behavior and find bugs</li>
  </Appear>
</Components.ul>

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="How to test this component?"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/3-naive-approach-shortened.js').default}
  steps={[{ notes: '' }]}
/>

---

## Let's extract pieces and test them separately

aka. **unit testing** - testing a single unit (of a program) at a time, in isolation

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="Data processing that could be extracted"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/2-naive-approach-hooks.js').default}
  steps={[
    {},
    {
      range: [12, 42],
      notes: 'Data processing',
    },
  ]}
/>

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="Extracted function that processes data points"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/4-single-data-point.js').default}
  steps={[{}]}
/>

---

## A naive test

```tsx
const result = processChartPoint({ year: '2010', month: '1', temperature: 8 })

if (result.color !== 'red') {
  console.error('Color is wrong for temperature = 8')
}
```

---

## But wait, there are libraries for that

1. Assertion libraries
2. Test runners

---

### Assertion libraries

- provide functions that test results against some expectations

```tsx
expect(result).toBe('hello world')
expect(1 + 2).toBe(3)
expect('some long string').toContain('long')
expect(result).toEqual({
  some: 'object',
})
```

Examples: [chai](http://chaijs.com/), [**jasmine**](http://jasmine.github.io/), [**jest**](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

---

### Test runners

- provide structure of tests and methods to declare them
- provide utility methods that run before/after each/all tests
- run tests

```tsx
describe('Global temperature chart', () => {
  describe('processChartPoint', () => {
    it('should map temperature below 5 to blue', () => {
      // invoke `processChartPoint` and use an assertion to test the result
    })
  })
})
```

Examples: [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [**jasmine**](http://jasmine.github.io/), [**jest**](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="A full test"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/4b-example-test.js').default}
  steps={[
    {},
    {
      range: [5, 14],
      notes: 'AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert',
    },
    {
      range: [6, 7],
      notes: 'Arrange - prepare all the preconditions',
    },
    {
      range: [9, 10],
      notes: 'Act - invoke the tested function',
    },
    {
      range: [12, 13],
      notes: 'Assert - check if the result matches the expectations',
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Run tests

- Each test runner has its own configuration
- I recommend _jest_ as it seems the easiest to set up
- _jest_ is the default tool in _create-react-app_

```sh
jest process-chart-point.js
# Or, to run tests after every change
jest process-chart-point.js --watch

```

## Workshop preparation

1. Clone https://github.com/Gelio/js-testing-workshop
2. Run `npm install`
3. Enter the `workshop/src` directory

---

## Task 1

1. Checkout the `task-1` branch
2. Write unit tests for `processChartPoint`

- use `npm run test -- --watch` to run the tests
- make sure every case is covered
- try to not repeat code
- maybe there is a way to write a single test, but with different inputs?

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="What to test next?"
  code={
    require('!raw-loader!./snippets/5-component-using-external-data-processing.js')
      .default
  }
  steps={[
    {},
    {
      range: [10, 21],
      notes: 'How about data fetching?',
    },
  ]}
/>

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="Extracted data-fetching part"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/6-extracted-data-fetching.js').default}
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Notice any problems?' },
    { lines: [4], notes: 'Using fetch will result in a network request' },
  ]}
/>

---

### Why issuing network requests in tests is not a good idea?

1. Increased test duration (imagine fetching that data in multiple tests)
2. A network request may fail (or timeout)
3. Not much control over the amount of retrieved payload

   What if we wanted to cover multiple cases, e.g. empty file, file with data set 1, file with data set 2, etc.

---

### How to mitigate the problem?

**Dependency injection** (DI) - injecting a necessary piece of code (a function, an object) to a
component dynamically at runtime instead of using a direct static link in the code

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="Data-fetching with dependency injection"

  steps={[
    {},
    {
      lines: [3, 4],
      notes:
        'fetch is now provided as a parameter. The global fetch is not referenced directly',
    },
    {
      lines: [13, 14],
      notes: 'Usage is similar, but now the global fetch has to be passed in',
    },
  ]}
/>

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="How does it help?"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/8-mocked-fetch.js').default}
  steps={[
    {
      notes:
        'fetch can now be mocked - only imitate a real network request, but return fake data',
    },
  ]}
/>

---

## Task 2

`getGlobalTemperatureChartData` still uses a real `processChartPoint`

1. Checkout branch `task-2`
2. Provide `processChartPoint` as a dependency
3. Write tests to fully test `getGlobalTemperatureChartData` (all cases)

- experiment with _jest_'s `jest.fn` (mock)
- see what **spy** functions are available via `jest.fn` (e.g. `.toHaveBeenCalled`)

---

---

## Cases to be tested in task 2

- happy path - network request succeeds
- network request succeeds, but returned data is in wrong shape (not an array)
- network request fails

## Math time

  alt="Math time"
/>

---

## Functional programming digression

`getGlobalTemperatureChartData` is now a **pure function** and maintains **referential transparency**

---

## Pure functions

1. Does not use any external symbols or global state.
2. Uses only its parameters
3. Is easy to test, as it does not require any particular global setup

---

## Referential transparency

1. Invoking the function with the same arguments yields the same results
2. Does not rely on global state
3. The function invocation can be replaced with its return value and the behavior of the program should not change

   ```tsx
   const result = someFunction()
   ```

   should be exactly the same as

   ```tsx
   const result = /* the return value of someFunction(); */
   ```

---

## TDD - Test Driven Development

- alternative way of development

- writing tests before writing code (tests are _red_)
- then, writing just enough code so that tests pass (tests are _green_)
- writing more tests to cover other cases

---

<ThemedCodeSurfer
  title="TDD example"
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/14-tdd-example.js').default}
  steps={[
    {
      notes:
        'We will try to write this function complying to an extreme TDD approach',
      range: [1, 31],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Start with an empty function signature',
      lines: [33],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Initial test',
      range: [35, 48],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Implementation that makes that test pass',
      range: [35, 55],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Another test, implementation does not cover it',
      range: [57, 84],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Implementation has to be modified to cover both those tests',
      range: [86, 92],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Yet another case tested',
      range: [121, 131],
    },
    {
      notes: 'Yet another implementation modification',
      range: [135, 149],
    },
    {
      notes:
        'And so on, until all cases are covered by tests and the implementation passes',
      range: [135, 151],
    },
  ]}
/>

---

## Test coverage

- codebase analysis that provides a useful and measurable metric
- displays lines of code that were run during tests
- useful to determine branches of execution (`if`s, `switch`es, etc.) and functions that are not tested
- in an ideal world, code coverage should be increased with each PR

Tools: **jest** (by default), [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc)

---

<ImageWithLabel label="Test coverage using jest">
  <img src="https://jestjs.io/img/content/feature-coverage.png" height="800" />
</ImageWithLabel>

---

## Test coverage live

1. Checkout branch `task-3`
2. Run `npm run test -- --coverage --watchAll`
3. Take a look at the generated coverage
4. Notice which functions and branches are not covered
5. (optional) Create more tests and see how the coverage changes

---

## A word about CI

<img
  src="https://media.giphy.com/media/14cHY86AYr24o0/giphy.gif"
  alt="Human and robot high fiving"
/>

---

## Testing in CI

CI - Continous Integration

- running some processes after each commit/push on a separate machine (usually in the cloud)
- processes include: _building the app_, _linting_, _testing_
- faster code verification (e.g. reviewers do not have to build the code themselves to see that linting fails)
- PRs may be temporarily rejected if CI fails

Example CI services: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [Azure
Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/pl-pl/services/devops/pipelines/),
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

Most are free for public, open source projects

## Understanding legacy code through tests

- faced with complex, legacy code
- instead of trying to take it in all at once, try writing tests
- they will serve as documentation
- they will help understand that code
- they will help catch regressions in case of a refactor

---

## Unit tests summary

- test single components/functions in isolation
- fast
- small
- relatively easy to write
- serve as basic documentation
- can help understand complex legacy code
- very useful for testing business logic (pure functions, functions that process data, reducers, etc.)
- do not guarantee that the app will ever work (does not integrate modules)

---

## Unit tests guidelines

1. Use Dependency Injection and mocks to isolate modules/components into units
2. Use spies (mocked functions) to test if a function has been invoked and what were the arguments
3. Use code coverage reporting tools to determine how much of the project is covered by tests
4. Integrate testing into your CI pipeline for fast verification
5. Do not obsess trying to get code coverage to 100%
6. Do not obsess with mocking everything

---

## Integration

  alt="Items in a box"
  width="80%"
/>

---

## Integration tests

Test multiple modules and their interactions

Sometimes it is hard to tell whether the test is an unit test or an integration test.

Sometimes mixed tests are used (some dependencies are mocked, some are not).

---

## Testing React components

Popular libraries:

- [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
- [**react-testing-library**](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)

---

## react-testing-library

- renders React components in a test environment
- allows component interaction (component lifecycle, user events, etc.)

  ]}
/>

---

## Integration tests task

1. Checkout `task-4` branch
2. Write 2 more tests: check the success path and the error path
3. Observe the results of `npm run test`

- ignore the warnings about _An update to ..._ and _The callback passed to ..._

  They are due to testing hooks, which is not yet fully supported

- those would not be problems with regular classes

---

## End-to-end tests

---

## End-to-end (e2e) tests

- automatic testing in a real environment
- no mocks, only using a built app via a browser
- using a browser as a regular user would
- usually a _staging_ environment is used on a backend
- e2e tests usually take the longest time to complete

Example tools: [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/),
[testcafe](https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe), [**cypress**](https://www.cypress.io/)

---

## cypress

- friendly API that looks synchronous
- a dashboard for inspecting tests step-by-step
- allows taking screenshots and saving pages to PDF
- can capture video of a test
- only withs with Chrome and Electron

---

---

## E2E task

1. Checkout branch `task-5`
2. Edit `App.js`: add a _decrement_ button and display `text`, but reversed
3. Add tests for the newly added behavior

- use `npm run cypress:open` to open Cypress GUI
- use `npm run cypress:run` to run a test suite in the console

---

## Visual tests

---

## Visual testing

- components can be displayed in isolation
- screenshots of the app can be compared across commits
- visual differences can be found by diffing the screenshots
